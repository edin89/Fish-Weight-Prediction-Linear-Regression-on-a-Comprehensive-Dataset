# Fish-Weight-Prediction-Linear-Regression-on-a-Comprehensive-Dataset
Using linear regression, this project aims to predict fish weight based on a comprehensive dataset. By analyzing various factors, it seeks to uncover relationships and provide accurate weight estimates. The results can contribute to better understanding and management of fish populations.
For the count of individual species, create a bar chart using the fish dataset, where species are represented on the x-axis and their counts on the y-axis.

Identify outliers in the dataset by utilizing statistical methods like z-score or interquartile range (IQR), and remove them based on specific criteria.

Build a regression model using relevant independent variables (e.g., length, width, species) to predict the dependent variable (fish weight), and print the regression equation to represent the relationship.

Calculate the mean score of the regression model at a 95% confidence interval using techniques like cross-validation or bootstrapping.

Compare the real and predicted weights from the regression model, assessing accuracy using metrics like MAE or RMSE, and draw conclusions about the model's effectiveness in predicting fish weights.
